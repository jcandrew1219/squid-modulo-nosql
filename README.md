  ## Description
  This project was meant to help me learn the concept of non relational databases using MongoDB. I started this project from scratch only using what I had learned in class as a model. The user must run mongodb in their terminal, initialize Express using `npm start` and then manipulate and view data through Compass and Insomnia. Once the user adds users and thoughts, the user should be able the view utilize all the other routes.

  ## Installation
  Installation requires npm packages mongoose, Express and Moment. MongoDB Compass must also be installed.

  ## Usage
  The user must set up a MongoDB server, run npm start to run the Express server and then add users and thoughts using insomnia. Once users and thoughts are added the rest of the routes will be usable.
